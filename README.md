# WolverineSoft Studios Dev Blog

Hello! My name is Mandy Chen, and I'm a student at the University of Michigan, where I'm studying Computer Science. As a member of Wolverinesoft Studios, I am passionate about making video games.

This dev blog is part of my coursework for ENGR 455, where Iâ€™ll be documenting my journey in contributing to Project Dragonheart. The goal of this blog is to share what I learn along the way, and I hope you will join me!
