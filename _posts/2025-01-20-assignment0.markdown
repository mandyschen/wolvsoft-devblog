# Introduction
Hello! My name is Mandy Chen, and I'm a student at the University of Michigan, 
where I'm studying Computer Science. As a member of Wolverinesoft Studios, 
I am passionate about making video games.

This dev blog is part of my coursework for ENGR 455, where Iâ€™ll be documenting 
my journey in contributing to Project Dragonheart. The goal of this blog is to share what I 
learn along the way, and I hope you will join me! 


# Past Projects
I created [Seal Survival](https://github.com/mandyschen/SealSurvival) as an application to WolverineSoft Studios.
